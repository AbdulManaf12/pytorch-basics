This repo will cover certain basics of pytorch So any inidiviual can learn easily and work with this package but to learn pytorch here I am assuming you have atleast some basics with python and its packages like numpy, tensorflow, keras. Along with some basics of Machine learning or work with image classification at minimum.

By visiting this link `https://pytorch.org/` you will reach at official webpage of pytorch package, from where you can easily install with corresponding specification of your system. Along with this, you can also explore it's official documentation you can check that too.
